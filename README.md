# rhosy: "Rhodes™-inspired" demo synth
Bart Massey and students 2024

This is a simple synthesizer written in Python in
conjunction with the students of Portland State University
CS 416/516 Computers Sound and Music. The synth is primarily
intended as a demonstration of implementation of synthesis
techniques.

A stretch goal for this particular synth is to implement
some kind of decent Fender Rhodes™ inspired electric piano
sound.
